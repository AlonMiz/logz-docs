Logz.io Cloud SIEM will help you detect threats and investigate security incidents as soon as you start sending logs.
Here's how your Cloud SIEM will help you reduce mean-time-to-response and improve team productivity.

### Get started in minutes

Pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards make it simple to start identifying threats straight away.

The list of rules and dashboards is continuously expanding and Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds content and improvements on a regular basis.

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers for any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.


### Investigate events systematically with structured workflows

Easily investigate security events using Cloud SIEM's **Investigate** and **Drilldown** features.

Click the **Investigate** button in your triggered alerts to review the logs and get all of the relevant details surrounding the event.

Then, continue your investigation using **Drilldown links** that take you directly from the most informative fields to other relevant dashboards so you can further expand your understanding of the event.

You can add your own Drilldown links to add to pre-built workflows and fine tune your processes.


### Threat Intelligence

A dedicated dashboard will help you perform preemptive threat hunting more effeciently.

Cloud SIEM cross references incoming logs against industry-recommended threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs. Logs are scanned for appearances of IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.

Threats are tagged by their level of severity as indicated by the confidence of the source, to help reduce false-positives and to promote response to higher-risk threats.


### Dedicated support from security experts

Benefit from a smooth onboarding experience with Logz.io's security experts and get the customizations you request per your security products and environments.

Your first-class experience doesn't end there. Ongoing guidance and customer support will ensure the success and ROI of your implementation.

### 10 Year retention

Cloud SIEM retains security logs for 10 years. Those include logs of any triggered security rules.

This extended time frame ensures that your company retains information long enough to investigate incidents without loss of critical data.
