Logz.io Cloud SIEM will help you detect threats and investigate security incidents as soon as you start sending logs.
Here's how your Cloud SIEM will help you reduce mean-time-to-response and improve team productivity.


### Familiar interface

The Cloud SIEM is built on top of the ELK Stack so teams can use familiar analytics tools for securing their environments.


### Centralize security operations

Powerful enough to run on petabytes of data, Cloud SIEM aggregates security incidents to help you set priorities and decide which events to investigate first based on their severity, threat level, and by correlating them with industry-standard threat intelligence feeds.

Cloud SIEM can use the same application logs used for monitoring production issues to find security threats and issues. For the most advanced and powerful experience, you'll want to integrate Logz.io Cloud SIEM with as many of the security services and platforms in use by your environments as possible.

### Zero ramp-up time

Pre-configured security rules and monitoring dashboards make it simple to start identifying threats straight away.

The list of rules and dashboards is continuously expanding and Logz.io's dedicated team of security experts adds content and improvements on a regular basis.

You can configure your own notification settings and threshold triggers for any security rule to stay notified in real time of security incidents.

### Threat Intelligence

Cloud SIEM cross references incoming logs against industry-recommended threat feeds to identify malicious IPs, DNSs, and URLs.

Logs are scanned for appearances of IOCs (Indicator of Compromise) and enriched when they are found.


### Drilldowns

Investigate events using drilldown links that direct you to the relevant dashboard.


### Reports

Generate scheduled reporting for audits and to track progress over time.

### Compliance

Cloud SIEM helps you comply with regulatory standards such as GDPR and PCI using built-in reports, rules, and dashboards.

### Dedicated support from security experts

Benefit from ongoing security guidance from Logz.io's team of security experts and get access to world-class customer support.

### 10 Year retention

Cloud SIEM retains logs of any triggered security rules for 10 years. This extended timeframe ensures that your company retains information long enough to investigate incidents without loss of critical data.
